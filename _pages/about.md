Hi, I'm Dina. Currently, I am a third-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Boston University, advised by Professor Kate Saenko. Prior to that, I received my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at Kazan Federal University. 

My research is focused on computer vision, deep learning, and pixel-level domain adaptation. Specifically, I am interested in realistic and disentangled unsupervised image-to-image and video-to-video translation using generative models. I am also passionate about computer-aided healthcare systems.
