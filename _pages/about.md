Hi, I'm Dina. Currently I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science Department at Boston University, advised by Prof. Kate Saenko. Prior to that, I received my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at Kazan Federal University. 

My research is focused on computer vision, deep learning and pixel-level domain adaptation. Specifically, I am interested in realistic unsupervised image-to-image and video-to-video translation using generative models. I am also passionate about computer-aided healthcare systems.
